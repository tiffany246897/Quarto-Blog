This project explores the happiness of people from different countries and the some of the many variables that may contribute to one’s happiness.\n\n\nThe datasets highlighted in this assignment aims to analyze the happiness of citizens in each country, focusing on different variables that may influence them. One dataset discusses the changes of these variables in each country over the years while the other dataset describes the 2022 happiness scores of each country, with the supporting variable scores.\n\n\n\nThis data is taken from the 2022 World Happiness Report at https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/.\n\n\n\nI think one of the many things I’m interested in and enjoy analyzing is human behavior – why people think a certain way and/or how things may affect them. With Generation Z bringing a lot more awareness to mental health, it sparked a curiosity in me to think about our happiness and what factors may play a role. Is it dependent on our countries’ policies? Our cultural factors? What variables are there? With COVID-19 trampling our world in recent years, I’ve also thought a lot about how that has affected who we are as a society. I know I personally have been affected by this in more ways than one, so I was curious to see if the numbers reflect this as well, especially when it pertains to our happiness.\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, I decided to compare the happiness variable factors of different countries, contrasting those of high rankings and those with low. I am curious to know: * Which variable plays the largest factor in the happiness of each country? * Does that variable have any correlation with other vairables? What examples can we use to support these relationships?\nDue to COVID occurring in recent years, I also wanted to see if there was any major difference between the two countries (or even if COVID is reflected in the data of each individual country).\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nHappiness_Report = 'HappinessReportCSV.csv'\nHappiness_Score = 'HappinessScoreData.csv'\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(Happiness_Report)\ndf2 = pd.read_csv(Happiness_Score)\n\n\ndf1.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry name\nyear\nLife Ladder\nLog GDP per capita\nSocial support\nHealthy life expectancy at birth\nFreedom to make life choices\nGenerosity\nPerceptions of corruption\nPositive affect\nNegative affect\nConfidence in national government\n\n\n\n\n0\nAfghanistan\n2008\n3.723590\n7.302574\n0.450662\n50.500000\n0.718114\n0.173169\n0.881686\n0.414297\n0.258195\n0.612072\n\n\n1\nAfghanistan\n2009\n4.401778\n7.472446\n0.552308\n50.799999\n0.678896\n0.195469\n0.850035\n0.481421\n0.237092\n0.611545\n\n\n2\nAfghanistan\n2010\n4.758381\n7.579183\n0.539075\n51.099998\n0.600127\n0.125859\n0.706766\n0.516907\n0.275324\n0.299357\n\n\n3\nAfghanistan\n2011\n3.831719\n7.552006\n0.521104\n51.400002\n0.495901\n0.167723\n0.731109\n0.479835\n0.267175\n0.307386\n\n\n4\nAfghanistan\n2012\n3.782938\n7.637953\n0.520637\n51.700001\n0.530935\n0.241247\n0.775620\n0.613513\n0.267919\n0.435440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset discusses different variables that was used to measure the happiness of citizens in different countries.
